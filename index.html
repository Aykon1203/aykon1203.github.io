    <h1>Opera: The Fastest Browser</h1>
    <p><img src=images/opera.png alt="Opera Logo" height="200"></p>
    <p>Opera is a web browser and internet suite developed by the Norwegian company Opera Software.

        Opera is available for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, QNX and BeOS platforms. In addition to the PC, the browser is available for the mobile phone, the Nintendo DSi and the Nintendo Wii in the form of Opera Mini and Opera Mobile. In addition, a 'portable' version is available, allowing Opera to work from, for example, a USB stick.
        
        In 2019, Opera introduced the 'World's first gaming browser', Opera GX, with a number of additional features.
        
        The browser has a market share of 1 to 3 percent.</p>
    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>The program has a newsgroup reader, an RSS reader, an IRC client and a BitTorrent client. The browser also used to have an integrated email function, but that has been decoupled from Opera into a separate program, Opera Mail.

        Opera works standard with a Tabbed Document Interface in addition to a Multiple Document Interface. A Single Document Interface can also be chosen. Opera was the first to support all these modes. Opera was one of the first browsers to introduce the concept of tabbed browsing, InternetWorks was the first. Almost all web browsers nowadays offer the option to use tabs.
        
        Another innovation is the so-called mouse gestures. These allow the user to perform frequently used commands such as reload, new page, back and the like more quickly. Mouse gestures work by pressing a mouse button and making a movement with the mouse at the same time.
        
        Opera further distinguishes itself from other browsers by its extensive keyboard navigation. Without using the mouse, hyperlinks on a web page can be pointed out by a combination of the Shift key and the arrow keys.
        
        Opera has support for HTML5's video and audio tag. Furthermore, the browser has the following functions:
        
        Extensions, to extend functionality
        Workplaces, which act as a kind of extra pages
        Themes, to customize the appearance
        User scripts, to influence the operation of websites, can be compared to Greasemonkey
        Web notifications, since version 25
        Bookmarks and tabs synchronization, introduced in version 29, with an Opera account
        Synchronizing passwords is possible in version 32 and higher.
        In addition to all these functions, Opera GX also has functions for gamers, as they describe it themselves. These are additions such as limitations on RAM, CPU and network and built-in applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Income</h2>
    <p>Opera has been free and ad-free since version 8.50 from September 2005. Previous free versions included an advertising banner, which was only hidden after purchasing a license. The Opera company now generates revenue from browser searches and sales of Opera for mobile phones.</p>
